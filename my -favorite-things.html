    <h1>Butterfly</h1>

    <p>One of my favorite things is a butterfly. Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their larvae, known as caterpillars, will feed.</p>
    <p>In as much as I may love butterflies, I am totally <em>repulsed by caterpillars</em>!</p>
    <p>The caterpillars grow, sometimes rapidly, and when fully developed, pupate in a chrysalis. When metamorphosis is complete, the adult insect climbs out and flies off after its wings have expanded and dried off.</p>
